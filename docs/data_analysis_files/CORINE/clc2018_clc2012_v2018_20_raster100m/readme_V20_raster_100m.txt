Corine Land Cover European seamless 100m raster database (Version 20 - final delivery)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This directory contains the Corine Land Cover European seamless raster database 
version 20 (dated 05/2019) in GeoTiff format. 

Vector databases was provided by National Teams within I&CLC2000, CARDS, CLC2006, CLC2012 and CLC2018 project. 
All features in original vector database were classified and digitised based on satellite images 
with 100 m positional accuracy (according to CLC specifications) and 25 ha minimum mapping unit (5ha MMU 
for change layer) into the standardized CLC nomenclature (44 CLC classes). EU CORINE Land Cover 
seamless DB represents the final product of European CLC2000 data integration. 
Harmonization on country border done for CLC2000 and CHA9000 (2km strip) for other themes only small artefact 
along borders (0,1ha) has been removed.
All seamless vector layers were rasterized to the 100m resolution grid. CELL_CENTER method was used for the rasterizing.

Version 3
First real seamless release in ESRI Geodatabase format.
New layers (CLC06 and CHA06) included as result of CLC2006 mapping (36 countries) 
New countries were included in CLC90, CLC00 and CHA00 as available from CLC2006 related mapping.
Sea buffers has been introduced (15km as proxy to 12 nautical miles sea zone).

version 2
All issues in tiles or tile borders, which has been reported by users was corrected.
Original idea was to deliver one big seamless layer, but as it has showed to be not feasible in 
ESRI environment yet it was decided to produce seamless tiles again (but free of any tiling artefacts).
New country deliveries available integrated: Iceland, Montenegro, Serbia, Kosovo from CARDS and CLC2006 projects 
were included. Limited country harmonization done for these add-ons (small artefacts cleaned only).


version 1
Initial version includes all I&CLC2000 project countries
Harmonization on country border done (2km strip)
